## Sorting Visualizer

Choose a sorting algorithm: Bubble, Merge or Quick, the array size, and sorting speed, and see the sorting in action! Use **Set Race** to watch the algorithms compete who's faster.

## Path Finder

In this module the user can generate a maze, which is implemented as a graph with a Union-Find data structure to create a anywhere-to-anywhere passage. The maze has golden prize, and the DFS/BFS search algorithms are trying to get to it, each in his own unique way.
